# Parallel Patterns with C and OpenMP #

This repo contains my project assignment for the course of Concurrency and Paral-lelism 2019-20. For this project we were supposed to use the C programming language and Intel's OpenMP library to implement several parallel patterns and algortihms we deemed interesting (such as the parallel-prefix). I decided to use GNU Argp to parse the program arguments and make it extremely easier to understand how the program works.

The repo also contains Python scripts that test the program and plot its performance relative to the number of threads.
