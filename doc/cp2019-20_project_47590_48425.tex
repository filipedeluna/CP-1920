\section{Introduction}
For the Concurrency and Parallelism course of the Integrated Masters in Computer Science at FCT-NOVA, we were asked to implement a series of parallel patterns using the OpenMP API. The following document describes our implementation of these patterns, the results we’ve achieved during the testing phase and our interpretation of these same results.

\section{Tools}

We developed the project in Linux using C language and the GCC compiler, writing our code in Clion and using CMake for building. We used the standard GNU argument parser (argp) \cite{argp}, to make testing a lot easier by adding flags and arguments to our program such as: test id, debug mode, thread count and weight enabling.

Our most important tool was OpenMP \cite{omp}, a multiplatform API that allows the user to add pragmas to programming blocks in order to parallelize code. The main perk of OpenMP is that parallel code ends up looking extremely similar to serial code, meaning serial execution is still possible.

\section{Testing Methodology}

We have created two python scripts to aid us in testing.

The first script, named “tester”, runs the program several times with the appropriate flags and saves the results. The tester can be configured to run a specific algorithm or all with a set of iterations, number of threads and, lastly, the number of repetitions for every test/iterations/thread combo. From these repetitions, we extract a mean value for a more accurate result. All these results are written to a file of our choosing.

The tester also allowed for configuring tests to run with different sets of iterations, since some algorithms run a lot faster than others and we needed to keep overall testing times low.  Another parameter, was “weight”, which activated a flag in the program that added a for loop with a configurable number of iterations for every worker. This was necessary since some algorithms had a very significant management cost and it allowed us to simulate a heavier work load in order to visualize their gains more accurately.

The second python script, the “grapher”, reads the output file with the results and creates a graph for each test, using Matplotlib \cite{matplotlib}, in order to help us visualize the data. 

Since our computers had a limited core count, we couldn’t get a realistic perception of the gains that the parallelization of these patterns could allow for. So we ran our tests in the cluster maintained by our Faculty’s Department of Informatics. The particular node we used for tests had 64 cores.
